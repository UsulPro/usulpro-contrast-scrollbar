# UsulPro Contrast Scrollbar
The tiny scrollbar extension for [Brackets](http://brackets.io) editor. Inspired by [osxscrollbars](https://github.com/cgaspard/brackets-osxscrollbars) extension and [brackets-chrome](https://github.com/cipherboy/brackets-chrome) theme

It was designed so that under some conditions the standard scrollbar becomes very difficult to see that annoying and distracting from work.
The appearance automatically changes depending on the dark / light theme using. You can see how it looks before installing

## OS
It should works for windows, mac and linux, but was tested only for windows system. So could you give me a feedback how it looks for other OS? :blush:
